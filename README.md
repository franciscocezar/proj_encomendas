# Packages Register
### System for controlling incoming and outgoing of packages.
### The information is saved in a database for query, and a PDF report can be generated with all the data.

#### `The idea for this project came about because of the huge amount of packages that my colleagues and I had to deal with during the pandemic, when I was still working as a gatekeeper in a condo.`
###### *Fictitious data.

## My purpose with this project:
#### Practicing:
   `Python`
   
   `CRUD`
   
   `OOP (object-oriented programming)`
   
   `In addition to helping my former co-workers`
   
## Credits:
This project was based on a project by professor Rafael Serafim from the RfZorzi YouTube channel, which I really recommend for learning Python.
