# Package Delivery Management System for Condominiums
### This program aims to simplify and organize the process of receiving packages. Using the program, it is possible to register details about each delivery, such as:
 
- date and time of delivery of the package (automatically generated);
- package code;
- the recipient's name and address;
- name of the employee who received it;
- pickup date and time (automatically generated) and
- name of the person who picked it up.

It also generates a report with all the information. The program helps improve the resident's experience and increase the productivity of the doorman team, ensuring greater efficiency and security in the delivery process.


#### `The idea for this project came about because of the huge amount of packages that my colleagues and I had to deal with during the pandemic, when I was still working as a gatekeeper in a condo.`

## Credits:
This project was based on a project by professor Rafael Serafim from the [RfZorzi's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtrZcoVD1WM&list=PLqx8fDb-FZDFznZcXb_u_NyiQ7Nai674-), which I really recommend for learning Python.
